-- going back and forth between chapters to remember functions
-- eg. I couldn't remember translucent so had to go back to chpt 1 
-- even though I was on chpt 1

-- I couldn't tab :/ it would shift entire line
-- eg. tab = to push = forward would tab entire line of code 

-- is there any way to make the code part smaller or larger 
-- like a drag to increase the ratio of editor vs viewer? eg like repl.it
